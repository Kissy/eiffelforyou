Hi I’m Heather, the face behind the camera that makes up Eiffel for You Photography.  
 
I’ve been photographing couples, families, and children for over a decade. 
I began my business in the United States but after a few years I realized my favorite location to shoot was Paris. 
I fell for the culture, the language, the food, the architecture, the fashion, and the Parisian way of life. 
The city of love captured my heart and for years I dreamed of moving my business here.  

Finally that dream came true. When I’m not behind my camera or my laptop, you can find me traveling the world, practicing French, or perhaps relaxing on a beach somewhere. 
I love art, cinema, and fashion. I’m also a foodie who loves to search for unique cafés. 
You can read about some of my adventures on my blog. After all, the best stories are told through pictures.

I know firsthand how important it is to capture memories and love stories. I hope you choose me to capture yours. 
Prior to becoming a photographer, I worked in the fashion industry and also dabbled in blogging and social media content creation. 
I know how to stylize and pose women. Let me choreograph your shoot, let’s bring a stunning, timeless vision to life together.
